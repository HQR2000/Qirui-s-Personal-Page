# Qirui's Personal Website

This repo is what I use to power my personal blog and portfolio site [qirui-he.vercel.app](qirui-he.vercel.app).

Thanks for the sharing of **Travis Fischer**, this repository is forked from his work [nextjs-notion-starter-kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit). By following some simple steps in his project, everyone can build their own website. Don't hesitate, have a try!
